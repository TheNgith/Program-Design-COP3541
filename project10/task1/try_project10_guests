# This is a Unix shell script that will be used to test project 6.
# To use the script, copy it into the same directory as your scource file
# Set execute permission for the file by issuing the command:
# chmod +x try_project10_guests
# Compile your program, producing a.out as the executable
# To run the script, type 
# ./try_project10_guests
# The user input from the script will not be shown on the screen.
# Compare the results from your program with the expected results on the test cases.
